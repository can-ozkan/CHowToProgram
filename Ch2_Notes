C programs contain one or more functions, one of which must be main. Every program in C begins executing at the function main.
Standard library functions like printf and scanf are not part of the C programming language. For example, the compiler cannot find a spelling error in printf or scanf. 
When the compiler compiles a printf statement, it merely provides space in the object program for a “call” to the library function. But the compiler does not 
know where the library functions are — the linker does. When the linker runs, it locates the library functions and inserts the proper calls to these library functions in 
the object program. Now the object program is complete and ready to be executed. For this reason, the linked program is called an executable.
